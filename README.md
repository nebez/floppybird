# [play floppy bird](https://nebezb.com/floppybird/)

If you missed the Flappy Bird hype, here's your chance to try the best vintage knockoff.

**Features**

* 🎉 good ol' div's for all the objects and graphics,
* 🖥 scales perfectly on almost any screen, both mobile and desktop,
* 💩 unoptimized, laggy, and not nearly as fast as a canvas implementation,
* 👷‍♂️ a typescript version that does almost nothing better over at [ts-floppybird](https://github.com/nebez/ts-floppybird)!

Enjoy.
